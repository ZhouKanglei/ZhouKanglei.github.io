Starting now, I am migrating to the Fediverse and
will no longer be publishing on X. This also applies to the communication
associated with the [LAMMPS Tutorials](https://lammpstutorials.github.io) organization. 
The main exceptions are my LinkedIn and Youtube accounts that I am keeping (for now).

The [Fediverse](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) is a network of social
platforms. Its decentralized nature prevents corporate monopolies and censorship.

You can [follow me on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@simongravelle), where
I will primarily post about science, molecular simulations, and open-source projects.
