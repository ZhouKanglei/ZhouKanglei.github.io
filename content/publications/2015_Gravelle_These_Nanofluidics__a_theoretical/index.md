abstract: "This thesis discusses various situations linked to transport at the nanoscale. The first chapter is an introduction to nanofluidics, containing a review of characteristic lengths, forces, or phenomena existing at the nanoscale. The second chapter is a study of the impact of geometry on the hydrodynamic permeability of a nanopore. This study, inspired by the shape of aquaporins, suggests a possible optimisation of permeability for bi-conical channels. The third chapter is a study of capillary filing inside subnanometric carbon channels which highlights the importance of the disjoining pressure induced by the fluid structuring inside the nanochannel. The fourth chapter is a study of nanofluidic diode, a component known to mimic the behaviour of semiconductor diode. The study highlights a strong coupling between water and ion dynamics which leads to a water flow rectification inside the diode. The fifth and last chapter is a study of the origin of commonly observed pink noise (1=f) in ionic current measurements through nanopores"
