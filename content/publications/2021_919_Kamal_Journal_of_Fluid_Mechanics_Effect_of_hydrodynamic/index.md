abstract: "The classical theory by Jeffery predicts that, in the absence of Brownian fluctuations, a thin rigid platelet rotates continuously in a shear flow, performing periodic orbits. However, a stable orientation is possible if the surface of the platelet displays a hydrodynamic slip length and apply our results to the quantification of the orientational contribution to the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of nanoplatelets with slip. We find a non-monotonic variation of this term, with a minimum occurring when the slip length is comparable to the thickness of the particle."
