abstract: "NMR relaxometry is a powerful and well-established experimental approach for characterizing dynamic processes in soft matter systems. All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1. However, such approaches are limited to time and length scales that prevent to model  systems such as long polymer chains or hydrogels. Coarse graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of losing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. Here, we address this issue by performing a systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1  on a PEG–H2O mixture at two different levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when compared to AA calculations but with a systematic offset. This offset is due to, on the one hand …"
