abstract: "The sliding motion of aqueous droplets on hydrophobic surfaces leads to charge separation at the trailing edge, with implications from triple-line friction to hydrovoltaic energy generation. Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to stem from ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We rationalize our observations through molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a new state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport and electrified matter at interfaces."
