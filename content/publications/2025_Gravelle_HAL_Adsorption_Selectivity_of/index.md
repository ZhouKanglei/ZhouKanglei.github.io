abstract: "The competition between hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions in water-ethanol mixtures gives rise to abnormal properties, such as the formation of an ethanol-rich surface layer at non-polar interfaces like graphite. This phenomenon, resulting from the balance between solid-liquid and liquid-liquid interactions, could benefit the development of microporous membranes for separating water-alcohol mixtures. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations of water-ethanol mixtures near planar organosilica surfaces, focussing on the role of surface properties in interfacial ethanol enrichment. Organosilica surfaces were chosen for their tunable hydrophobicity, achieved by varying the ratio of methyl to hydroxyl groups. Our findings reveal significant ethanol enrichment at hydrophobic organosilica surfaces decorated with methyl groups, similar to previous observations with graphite. We analyze ethanol enrichment in relation to mixture composition and surface properties, such as roughness and the spatial organization of surface groups. By demonstrating the ability of organosilica materials to preferentially adsorb ethanol over water, this work identifies a cost-effective alternative to carbon-based materials for the fabrication of filtration membranes."
